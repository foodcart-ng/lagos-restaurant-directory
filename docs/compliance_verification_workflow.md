### Compliance Score Calculation
```javascript
function calculateComplianceScore(restaurant) {
  let score = 0;
  let maxScore = 100;
  
  // NTDC Compliance (30 points)
  if (restaurant.compliance.ntdc_status === 'verified') {
    score += 30;
  } else if (restaurant.compliance.ntdc_status === 'expiring') {
    score += 20;
  }
  
  // NAFDAC Compliance (30 points)
  if (restaurant.compliance.nafdac_status === 'verified') {
    score += 30;
  } else if (restaurant.compliance.nafdac_status === 'expiring') {
    score += 20;
  }
  
  // Hygiene Rating (25 points)
  const hygieneScores = { 'A': 25, 'B': 20, 'C': 15 };
  score += hygieneScores[restaurant.compliance.hygiene_rating] || 0;
  
  // Sustainability Certifications (15 points)
  const sustainabilityBonus = restaurant.compliance.certifications.length * 3;
